	abstract     = {Sentiment analysis of scientiﬁc citations has received much attention in recent years because of the increased availability of scientiﬁc publications. Scholarly databases are valuable sources for publications and citation information where researchers can publish their ideas and results. Sentiment analysis of scientiﬁc citations aims to analyze the authors’ sentiments within scientiﬁc citations. During the last decade, some review papers have been published in the ﬁeld of sentiment analysis. Despite the growth in the size of scholarly databases and researchers’ interests, no one as far as we know has carried out an in-depth survey in a speciﬁc area of sentiment analysis in scientiﬁc citations. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of sentiment analysis of scientiﬁc citations. In this review, the process of scientiﬁc citation sentiment analysis is introduced and recently proposed methods with the main challenges are presented, analyzed and discussed. Further, we present related ﬁelds such as citation function classiﬁcation and citation recommendation that have recently gained enormous attention. Our contributions include identifying the most important challenges as well as the analysis and classiﬁcation of recent methods used in scientiﬁc citation sentiment analysis. Moreover, it presents the normal process, and this includes citation context extraction, public data sources, and feature selection. We found that most of the papers use classical machine learning methods. However, due to limitations of performance and manual feature selection in machine learning, we believe that in the future hybrid and deep learning methods can possibly handle the problems of scientiﬁc citation sentiment analysis more efﬁciently and reliably.},

	abstract     = {Quantifying scientific impact of researchers and journals relies largely on citation counts, despite the acknowledged limitations of this approach. The need for more suitable alternatives has prompted research into developing advanced metrics, such as h-index and Relative Citation Ratio ({RCR}), as well as better citation categorization schemes to capture the various functions that citations serve in a publication. One such scheme involves citation sentiment: whether a reference paper is cited positively (agreement with the findings of the reference paper), negatively (disagreement), or neutrally. The ability to classify citation function in this manner can be viewed as a first step toward a more fine-grained bibliometrics. In this study, we compared several approaches, varying in complexity, for classification of citation sentiment in clinical trial publications. Using a corpus of 285 discussion sections from as many publications (a total of 4,182 citations), we developed a rulebased method as well as supervised machine learning models based on support vector machines ({SVM}) and two variants of deep neural networks; namely, convolutional neural network ({CNN}) and bidirectional long shortterm memory ({BiLSTM}). A {CNN} model augmented with hand-crafted features yielded the best performance (0.882 accuracy and 0.721 macro-F1 on held-out set). Our results show that baseline performances of traditional supervised learning algorithms and deep neural network architectures are similar and that hand-crafted features based on sentiment dictionaries and rhetorical structure allow neural network approaches to outperform traditional machine learning approaches for this task. We make the rule-based method and the best-performing neural network model publicly available at: https://github.com/kilicogluh/clinical-citation-sentiment.},

	abstract     = {Citation represents the relationship between the cited and the citing document and vice versa. Citations are widely used to measure the different aspects of knowledge-based achievements such as institutional ranking, author ranking, the impact factor of the journal, research grants, and peer judgments. A fair evaluation of research required a quantitative and qualitative assessment of citations. To perform the qualitative analysis of citations, researchers tried to classify the citations into binary classes (i.e., important and non-important). To perform this task, researchers used metadata, content, citations count, cue words or phrases, sentiment analysis, keywords, and machine learning approaches for citation classification. However, the state-of-the-art results of binary classification are inadequate for the calculation of different aspects of the researcher and their work. Therefore, this research proposed an in-text citation sentiment analysis-based approach for binary classification which effectively enhanced the results of the state-of-the-art. In this research, different machine learning-based models are evaluated to determine the in-text citations sentiments. These sentiment results are further used for positive-negative, and neutral citation counts. Furthermore, the scores of cosine similarity between paper citation pairs are also calculated and used as a feature. This sentiment and cosine similarity scores are further used as features in binary classification. The classification is performed through {SVM}, {KLR}, and Random Forest. The proposed approach is evaluated and compared with two state-of-the-art approaches on the benchmark dataset. The proposed approach can achieve 0.83 f-measure with the improvement of 13.6\% for dataset 1 and 0.67 with an improvement of 8\% for dataset two with a random forest classification model.},

With the burgeoning computational models and open data movement, scientific repository can provide more evidence in support of recommendation. On the one hand, recommenders are applying better algorithms to understand the text of user queries and candidate citations. On the other hand, more types of data such as citation network and co-author relationship are aggregated to enrich the citation contextual information. The available data used for recommendation has been extended from textual content to enriched context. This review is conducted to identify the information and methods used for recommendations recently. We begin by introducing definitions of the task, recommending factors along with the corresponding problems and some application platforms. Then, we classify existing recommenders according to user query types and review representative methods for each type. We also elaborate on different strategies applied in three main stages of citation recommendation. Finally, a few open issues for future investigations are proposed.},

This task of analysis is cumbersome and timeconsuming because of the important growing number of published scientific papers. Some researchers have been focused on analyzing scientific citations and detecting the semantic links (sentiment polarity) between the document and its references. To address this problem, researchers use sentiment analysis, which is the computational study of people’s opinions, appraisals, attitudes, and emotions toward entities, individuals, issues, events, topics and their attributes. The task is technically challenging and practically very useful. This paper present some approaches adopted in the field of sentiment analysis, and more particularly, those used in citation sentiment analysis, which are classified generally in two main categories; lexicon-based approaches, and corpus-based approaches (machine learning and deep learning). A study of the area of application of each approach is also given. At the end of this study, we conclude that the techniques of machine learning are the most used but not the better.},

	abstract     = {Opinion mining (OM) is a recent subdiscipline at the crossroads of information retrieval and computational linguistics which is concerned not with the topic a document is about, but with the opinion it expresses. OM has a rich set of applications, ranging from tracking users opinions about products or about political candidates as expressed in online forums, to customer relationship management. In order to aid the extraction of opinions from text, recent research has tried to automatically determine the PNpolarity of subjective terms, i.e. identify whether a term that is a marker of opinionated content has a positive or a negative connotation. Research on determining whether a term is indeed a marker of opinionated content (a subjective term) or not (an objective term) has been instead much scarcer. In this work we describe SENTIWORDNET, a lexical resource in which each WORDNET synset sis associated to three numerical scores Obj(s), Pos(s) and Neg(s), describing how objective, positive, and negative the terms contained in the synset are. The method used to develop SENTIWORDNET is based on the quantitative analysis of the glosses associated to synsets, and on the use of the resulting vectorial term representations for semi-supervised synset classi.cation. The three scores are derived by combining the results produced by a committee of eight ternary classi.ers, all characterized by similar accuracy levels but different classification behaviour. SENTIWORDNET is freely available for research purposes, and is endowed with a Web-based graphical user interface.}

Both SENTIWORDNET 1.0 and 3.0 are the result of automatically annotating all WORDNET synsets according to their degrees of positivity, negativity, and neutrality. SENTIWORDNET 1.0 and 3.0 differ (a) in the versions of WORDNET which they annotate (WORDNET 2.0 and 3.0, respectively), (b) in the algorithm used for automatically annotating WORDNET, which now includes (additionally to the previous semi-supervised learning step) a random-walk step for refining the scores. We here discuss SENTIWORDNET 3.0, especially focussing on the improvements concerning aspect (b) that it embodies with respect to version 1.0. We also report the results of evaluating SENTIWORDNET 3.0 against a fragment of WORDNET 3.0 manually annotated for positivity, negativity, and neutrality; these results indicate accuracy improvements of about 20{\%} with respect to SENTIWORDNET 1.0.}

For example, an author editing a manuscript may use the same academic search engine to find the latest work on a particular topic or to find the correct citation for a familiar article. The author's tolerance for latency and accuracy may vary according to task. However, search engines typically employ a consistent approach for processing all queries. In this paper we explore how a range of search needs and expectations can be supported within a single search system using differential search. We introduce CiteSight, a system that provides personalized citation recommendations to author groups that vary based on task. CiteSight presents cached recommendations instantaneously for online tasks (e.g., active paper writing), and refines these recommendations in the background for offline tasks (e.g., future literature review). We develop an active cache-warming process to enhance the system as the author works, and context-coupling, a technique for augment sparse citation networks. By evaluating the quality of the recommendations and collecting user feedback, we show that differential search can provide a high level of accuracy for different tasks on different time scales. We believe that differential search can be used in many situations where the user's tolerance for latency and desired response vary dramatically based on use.},

A comparative sentence expresses an ordering relation between two sets of entities with respect to some common features. For example, the comparative sentence "Canon's optics are better than those of Sony and Nikon" expresses the comparative relation: (better, {optics}, {Canon}, {Sony, Nikon}). Given a set of evaluative texts on the Web, e.g., reviews, forum postings, and news articles, the task of comparative sentence mining is (1) to identify comparative sentences from the texts and (2) to extract comparative relations from the identified comparative sentences. This problem has many applications. For example, a product manufacturer wants to know customer opinions of its products in comparison with those of its competitors. In this paper, we propose two novel techniques based on two new types of sequential rules to perform the tasks. Experimental evaluation has been conducted using different types of evaluative texts from the Web. Results show that our techniques are very promising.},

	abstract     = {Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.},

	abstract     = {Sentiment analysis is concerned with the automatic extraction of sentiment-related information from text. Although most sentiment analysis addresses commercial tasks, such as extracting opinions from product reviews, there is increasing interest in the affective dimension of the social web, and Twitter in particular. Most sentiment analysis algorithms are not ideally suited to this task because they exploit indirect indicators of sentiment that can reflect genre or topic instead. Hence, such algorithms used to process social web texts can identify spurious sentiment patterns caused by topics rather than affective phenomena. This article assesses an improved version of the algorithm SentiStrength for sentiment strength detection across the social web that primarily uses direct indications of sentiment. The results from six diverse social web data sets (MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, Digg, RunnersWorld, BBCForums) indicate that SentiStrength 2 is successful in the sense of performing better than a baseline approach for all data sets in both supervised and unsupervised cases. SentiStrength is not always better than machine-learning approaches that exploit indirect indicators of sentiment, however, and is particularly weaker for positive sentiment in news-related discussions. Overall, the results suggest that, even unsupervised, SentiStrength is robust enough to be applied to a wide variety of different social web contexts.},

	abstract     = {{Motivation: Scholarly biomedical publications report on the findings of a research investigation. Scientists use a well-established discourse structure to relate their work to the state of the art, express their own motivation and hypotheses and report on their methods, results and conclusions. In previous work, we have proposed ways to explicitly annotate the structure of scientific investigations in scholarly publications. Here we present the means to facilitate automatic access to the scientific discourse of articles by automating the recognition of 11 categories at the sentence level, which we call Core Scientific Concepts (CoreSCs). These include: Hypothesis, Motivation, Goal, Object, Background, Method, Experiment, Model, Observation, Result and Conclusion. CoreSCs provide the structure and context to all statements and relations within an article and their automatic recognition can greatly facilitate biomedical information extraction by characterizing the different types of facts, hypotheses and evidence available in a scientific publication.Results: We have trained and compared machine learning classifiers (support vector machines and conditional random fields) on a corpus of 265 full articles in biochemistry and chemistry to automatically recognize CoreSCs. We have evaluated our automatic classifications against a manually annotated gold standard, and have achieved promising accuracies with ‘Experiment’, ‘Background’ and ‘Model’ being the categories with the highest F1-scores (76\\%, 62\\% and 53\\%, respectively). We have analysed the task of CoreSC annotation both from a sentence classification as well as sequence labelling perspective and we present a detailed feature evaluation. The most discriminative features are local sentence features such as unigrams, bigrams and grammatical dependencies while features encoding the document structure, such as section headings, also play an important role for some of the categories. We discuss the usefulness of automatically generated CoreSCs in two biomedical applications as well as work in progress.Availability: A web-based tool for the automatic annotation of articles with CoreSCs and corresponding documentation is available online at http://www.sapientaproject.com/softwarehttp://www.sapientaproject.com also contains detailed information pertaining to CoreSC annotation and links to annotation guidelines as well as a corpus of manually annotated articles, which served as our training data.Contact:liakata@ebi.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},
